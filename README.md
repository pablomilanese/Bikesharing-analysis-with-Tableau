## BIKESHARING


##### OVERVIEW OF THE ANALYSIS
The purpose of this analysis was to help Des Moines decide if a ridesharing service such as NYC's Citibike is a solid business proposal.  
We used Citi Bike public data to draw conclusions that apply both to NYC and to Des Moines. By asking the right questions and using critical thinking we were able to visualize our conclusions with the help of Tableau.

##### RESULTS

1. Checkout time for users - the grand mayority of users check out a Citibike for an average of five minutes, pacing out after 40 minutes. <img width="1212" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105120795/184562602-6664a146-90e0-488b-bbef-b74dde64cee5.png">
2. Checkout Times by Gender - Female, male and unknown gender users utilize a Citibike for the same amount of time as our first result. That being said, it is clear that most users are male. <img width="1209" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105120795/184562625-2c755ca1-d916-4d76-ba87-17001d71af99.png">
3. Trips by Weekday per Hour - the bussiest hours for Citibike users are between 11AM - 8PM in the weekends and 7AM-9AM + 5PM - 7PM during weekdays. We can assume that most bikes are being used during commute hours and for leisure during the weekends. <img width="788" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105120795/184562651-d1642ddb-fe18-4290-9e3d-24020f7eb2f9.png">
4. User Trips by Gender by Weekday - The highest demographic using Citibikes are male subscriber users.<img width="758" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105120795/184562666-d8598e6c-9a9a-4d38-9f1c-612153626086.png"> 
6. Start Location - Most starting points are concentrated in the heart of NYC. This could very well be a mix of commuters that live in the city and tourists wanting to explore the city. <img width="1219" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105120795/184562807-977b285e-e69c-4780-b1e2-1592c6315b93.png">
7. End Location - The end locations are very similar to the points found for the start locations. That being said, the points are not as concentrated as the ones in the starting locations. Meaning some users could be starting off at X and leaving their bikes at another location. <img width="1204" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105120795/184562839-336f47ad-81e3-483b-a33c-e67b342acb1b.png">
8. Customer Type Starting Point - We found that there is a higher concentration of similar starting points for subscribers vs customers. <img width="1209" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105120795/184562867-13109fd2-a37a-4ad0-883b-007cb64067af.png">

##### SUMMARY
Des Moines should consider the following points:
* The grand mayority of their userbase will be male subscribers. This means they should concentrate their starting locations around office buildings and apartment complexes near said buildings.
* End locations should be placed around similar starting locations as well as other points of interest in Des Moines. This will be helpful both to commuters and tourists wanting to visit other locations.
* Most Citibikes are being rented for less than an hour. This means that Des Moines should not worry much about specific bikes getting heavy usage. That being said there's enough information to understand that a third of the total bikes have some heavy usage. Reparations should be consider during planifications.

##### TWO ADDITIONAL POSSIBLE GRAPHS
* It would be useful to compare the amount of subscribers vs visitors that are using the bikes during the weekend vs weekdays. This could give Des Moines a better grasps of which bikes are the ones being used the most and for which reasons.
* Another path to explore is how do starting and ending points differ for customers vs subscribers. This could give Des Moines a better grasp of how these two users are different.
